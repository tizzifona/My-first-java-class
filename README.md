# My first java class

## ✅Description

This project is a Java program that models the concept of a Person. Each person has the following attributes:

First Name
Last Name
ID Number
Birth Year
The Person class includes a constructor that initializes these values for each person instance. In addition, the program extends the Person class to include two more attributes:

Country of Birth (String)
Gender (char) with allowed values 'F', 'M', or 'U'

The Person class also includes a method to print these attribute values to the console. An App class contains the main application logic and is responsible for creating instances of Person and displaying their attribute values in the terminal.

## ✅Features
